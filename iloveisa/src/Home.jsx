                <h1>Welcome to Isa Delahunty's website!</h1>
                <p>This site is devoted to the ONE and ONLY Isa Delahunty, my girlfriend and best friend.</p>
                <p>I have been so fortunate to have Isa Delahunty as my girlfriend since September 2024. In that time, I have never been happier and I (occasionally) feel very loved.
                    Together, we have had many adventures, from going to the beach, to going to the movies, to just hanging out at home. I love every moment we spend together and I hope we can continue to make more memories together.
                    I love you so much, Isa. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me and I am so grateful to have you in my life. I hope you enjoy this website and all the memories we have made together.
                    Best of luck in London, I'm going to miss you so much, but may this website be a reminder of all our fun times and how much love I have for you &lt;3
